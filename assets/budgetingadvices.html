					A budget deficit is when you spend more than you earn.<br/>
					<br/>
				Know your monthly income. It’s important to keep tabs on the amount of money you’re bringing in each month. <br/>
				This is especially important if you work multiple jobs, work inconsistent hourly shifts, perform contract or freelance<br/>
				labor, or receive grants. Knowing the approximate or average amount you bring in each month is key.<br/>
				<br/>
				Know your monthly expenses. Just as it’s important to know how much money you’re bringing in each month, you should<br/>
				also know how much money is going out. Monthly expenses, for most people, can be inconsistent. Your car doesn’t need a<br/>
				R2000 repair every month (hopefully). So, it’s good to do your best to figure out the average amount you spend each month,<br/>
				then use that when assessing your finances.<br/>
				<br/>
				Plan your spending to match your income. The last piece of the puzzle: once you know your money-out and money-in, <br/>
				you can plan expenses around the amount of money you’re bringing in. That way, you can ensure that you’re not draining <br/>
				your savings, living paycheck to paycheck, or running up a massive credit card debt to cover your costs of living. <br/>

				<p>Here are some ways you can save:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Eliminate you debts</li>
					<li>Set Saving Goals</li>
					<li>Spend to save</li>
					<li>Pack Lunchbox when going to work/school</li>
					<li>Look for cheaper ways to travel</li>
